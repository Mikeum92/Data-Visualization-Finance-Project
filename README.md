# Data-Visualization-Finance-Project
This data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. The aim is to practice my visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.

The project focuses on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the financial crisis all the way to early 2016.

The following python libaries are used for visualization:
      - pandas
      - numpy
      - matplotlib
      - plotly
      - cufflinks
